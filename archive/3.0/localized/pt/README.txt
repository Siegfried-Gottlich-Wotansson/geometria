The desktop version of GEOMETRIA requires Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or
higher installed on your computer. If you do not have JRE already installed,
you can download it from:

Make sure you download the JRE package suitable for your operating system,
whether it is Windows, Mac, Linux or Solaris.

Note: If you have an earlier version of JRE, you will need to upgrade to
version 1.5 or higher. You can download the latest version of JRE from the
location above.

Make sure the JRE executable is in your path. To check if JRE is in your path,
open a command window (Windows) or a terminal (Mac, Linux, Solaris) and enter:

java -version

It must show the version of JRE you are using. If it does not, follow the
instructions at:
